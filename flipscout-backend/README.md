# FlipScout Des Moines — Backend

A FastAPI backend that searches eBay for resale candidates, normalizes listings
into a marketplace-neutral shape, and computes **transparent, fully itemized**
profit estimates in exact decimal arithmetic.

This phase implements eBay only. The data model is deliberately
marketplace-neutral so Facebook Marketplace can be added later without
reshaping anything downstream.

---

## Read this first: two things this API will not pretend

### 1. eBay current listings are **not** sold comparables

`GET /api/ebay/search` uses the eBay **Browse** API, which returns **active
listings — asking prices**. An asking price is what a seller *hopes* to get.
It is not evidence of a sale.

Anyone can list a $12 item for $900 and leave it unsold for a year. If you feed
that $900 into a profit estimate, the arithmetic will be flawless and the
conclusion worthless.

**A low asking price does not make an item profitable, and a high asking price
does not establish resale value.** Before this becomes a real resale
estimator, `resale_price` must come from **authorized sold/completed
comparable data**:

- eBay **Marketplace Insights API** — returns sold data for the last 90 days.
  Access is **restricted**: you must apply and be approved by eBay.
- Another licensed sold-data provider under its terms of service.

Until such a source is wired in, treat `resale_price` as *your* assumption,
supplied by you, and do not attach a confidence score to it. This backend
computes; it does not appraise.

### 2. A 5× resale multiple is **400% gross ROI**, not 500% ROI

This trips people up constantly, and getting it wrong overstates a deal by a
full turn of capital.

Buy at **$100**, resell at **$500**:

| Quantity | Formula | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gross_multiple` | `500 / 100` | **5.0×** |
| `gross_roi_percent` | `(500 − 100) / 100 × 100` | **400%** |

Your $100 of capital *comes back to you*. Only the other $400 is profit. To
actually earn **500% gross ROI** you need a **6× multiple** ($100 → $600).

So the "500% potential" flag in this API is a **resale multiple** test:

```
qualifies_for_500_percent_resale_multiple = (gross_multiple >= 5)
```

It is returned as a separate field from `gross_roi_percent` precisely so the
two can never be read as each other. And note: qualifying on the multiple is
**not** a claim of profitability — a 5× item can still lose money once fees,
shipping, and repairs land (there is a test asserting exactly that).

## Requirements

- Python **3.11+**
- An eBay developer account (only for the live search endpoint)

---

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt          # runtime only
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt      # runtime + pytest
```

---

## Environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # then edit .env with your real values
```

`.env` is git-ignored. **Never commit real credentials.**

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EBAY_CLIENT_ID` | for search | — | eBay **App ID (Client ID)** |
| `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET` | for search | — | eBay **Cert ID (Client Secret)** |
| `EBAY_API_BASE` | no | `https://api.ebay.com` | Set to `https://api.sandbox.ebay.com` for sandbox |
| `EBAY_MARKETPLACE_ID` | no | `EBAY_US` | Sent as `X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID` |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | no | `20` | Per-request HTTP timeout |

The app **boots without eBay credentials**. `/health`, `/api/normalize/ebay`,
and `/api/profit-estimate` all work offline; only `/api/ebay/search` returns
`503` until credentials are set.

This project reads variables from the **process environment**. It does not
auto-load `.env`. Load it yourself:

```bash
set -a && source .env && set +a       # bash/zsh
```

…or use your process manager's env-file support (`docker run --env-file`,
systemd `EnvironmentFile=`, your platform's secret manager).

### Getting eBay developer credentials

1. Register at **https://developer.ebay.com/** (free).
2. Go to **Developer Portal → Application Keys**.
3. You get two keysets: **Sandbox** and **Production**.
4. Copy the **App ID (Client ID)** → `EBAY_CLIENT_ID`
   and the **Cert ID (Client Secret)** → `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET`.
5. Match the keyset to `EBAY_API_BASE`. **Sandbox keys do not work against
   production and vice versa** — that mismatch is the single most common cause
   of a `502 upstream_auth_error`.

Production Browse API access requires your application to be in good standing
under eBay's API License Agreement. Review eBay's rate limits before running
this at volume.

## Running the server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Then open the interactive API documentation:

- **Swagger UI** → http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
- **ReDoc** → http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc
- **Raw OpenAPI schema** → http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json

For production, drop `--reload` and run behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
```

---

## Endpoints

### `GET /health`

Liveness plus a configuration check. Reports **whether** credentials are
present — never their values.

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "ebay_api_base": "https://api.ebay.com",
  "ebay_marketplace_id": "EBAY_US",
  "ebay_credentials_configured": false
}
```

### `GET /api/ebay/search`

Searches eBay for **fixed-price and auction** inventory and returns normalized
listings. Remember: these are **asking prices**.

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `q` | string | *required* | 1–350 characters |
| `limit` | int | `50` | 1–200 (eBay's maximum) |
| `offset` | int | `0` | 0–9999 (eBay's maximum) |
| `condition` | enum | — | e.g. `NEW`, `USED_GOOD`, `FOR_PARTS_OR_NOT_WORKING` |
| `max_price` | number | — | Must be > 0; applied in `USD` |

```bash
# Basic search
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/ebay/search?q=vintage%20pyrex&limit=10"

# With condition and a price ceiling
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/ebay/search?q=nintendo%2064&limit=25&offset=0&condition=USED_GOOD&max_price=75"
```

```json
{
  "total": 137,
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 10,
  "listings": [
    {
      "source": "ebay",
      "source_item_id": "v1|123456789012|0",
      "title": "Vintage Pyrex Mixing Bowl Set",
      "url": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/123456789012",
      "price_value": "24.99",
      "price_currency": "USD",
      "shipping_cost": "8.45",
      "condition": "Used",
      "location_text": "Des Moines, IA, US",
      "listing_type": "FIXED_PRICE",
      "captured_at": "2026-08-30T12:00:00Z",
      "raw": { "...": "original eBay object, credentials redacted" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### `POST /api/normalize/ebay`

Normalizes a single raw eBay `itemSummary` — useful for debugging against real
payloads **without spending an API call**.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/normalize/ebay \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "itemId": "v1|123456789012|0",
        "title": "Vintage Pyrex Mixing Bowl Set",
        "itemWebUrl": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/123456789012",
        "price": {"value": "24.99", "currency": "USD"},
        "shippingOptions": [{"shippingCost": {"value": "8.45", "currency": "USD"}}],
        "condition": "Used",
        "seller": {"username": "desmoines_finds", "feedbackScore": 1423},
        "itemLocation": {"city": "Des Moines", "stateOrProvince": "IA", "country": "US"},
        "buyingOptions": ["FIXED_PRICE"]
      }'
```

### `POST /api/profit-estimate`

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/profit-estimate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "resale_price": "200.00",
        "purchase_price": "40.00",
        "marketplace_fee_rate": "0.1325",
        "payment_fee_rate": "0.0299",
        "shipping_cost": "12.00",
        "taxes": "2.80",
        "fuel_cost": "6.00",
        "repair_cost": "5.00",
        "cleaning_cost": "3.00",
        "packaging_cost": "2.20",
        "other_costs": "1.00"
      }'
```

```json
{
  "resale_price": "200.00",
  "purchase_price": "40.00",
  "gross_profit": "160.00",
  "total_selling_fees": "32.48",
  "total_other_costs": "32.00",
  "net_profit": "95.52",
  "gross_multiple": "5.0000",
  "gross_roi_percent": "400.00",
  "net_roi_percent": "91.42",
  "qualifies_for_500_percent_resale_multiple": true
}
```

Only `resale_price` and `purchase_price` are required; every cost defaults to
`0`. `marketplace_fee_rate` defaults to `0.1325`, and `payment_fee_rate`
defaults to `0` because **eBay's managed-payments final value fee already
bundles payment processing** — set it explicitly only for a marketplace that
bills processing separately.

#### Formulas

```
gross_profit      = resale_price − purchase_price
selling_fees      = resale_price × (marketplace_fee_rate + payment_fee_rate)
total_other_costs = shipping + taxes + fuel + repair + cleaning + packaging + other
net_profit        = resale_price − purchase_price − selling_fees − total_other_costs
gross_multiple    = resale_price / purchase_price
gross_roi_percent = gross_profit / purchase_price × 100
net_roi_percent   = net_profit / (purchase_price + selling_fees + total_other_costs) × 100

qualifies_for_500_percent_resale_multiple = gross_multiple >= 5
```

`purchase_price` must be **> 0** — it is the denominator of every ratio.

### Status codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `200` | Success |
| `400` | Invalid search input caught by the client layer |
| `422` | Request failed schema validation (bad type, negative money, unknown condition) |
| `429` | eBay rate-limited us — back off and retry |
| `502` | Upstream eBay failure (auth rejected, 5xx, malformed response) |
| `503` | **Server** misconfiguration — a required env var is missing |
| `504` | eBay did not respond within `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` |

`429` and `504` are used instead of a blanket `502` because both have canonical
meanings clients can act on automatically (back off; retry).

An eBay **auth** failure maps to `502`, not `401`: the caller of *this* API is
not the party who failed to authenticate — our upstream credential exchange is.

---

## Money is `Decimal`, and it serializes as a string

Every monetary value is a `decimal.Decimal` end to end. Binary floating point
is never used for prices, fees, or profit — in IEEE-754, `0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3`,
and a resale tool that is a cent off is a resale tool nobody trusts.

Consequently the API emits money as **JSON strings** (`"24.99"`, not `24.99`).
This is deliberate: a JSON number gets re-parsed as a float by nearly every
client, reintroducing exactly the error we removed. Parse these with your
language's decimal type — `Decimal("24.99")`, `new BigDecimal("24.99")`,
`new Decimal("24.99")` (decimal.js) — not `parseFloat`.

---

## Security

- **Secrets come from the environment only.** Never hardcode them, never put
  them in frontend code, never commit them. `.env` is git-ignored.
- **`EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET` is never exposed.** It is wrapped in
  `pydantic.SecretStr`, so an accidental `repr()` or log line prints
  `**********`. It appears in exactly one place: the `Basic` auth header of the
  token request. It is never in a response body, an exception message, or a log.
- **`raw` is sanitized.** The original eBay object is preserved for debugging,
  but any key resembling a credential (`authorization`, `access_token`,
  `client_secret`, `api_key`, `password`, …) is replaced with `[redacted]`
  recursively before it can reach a response or a log aggregator.
- **Tokens are never logged**, and `_CachedToken.__repr__` prints `'***'`.

Before deploying to production:

- Put the API behind **TLS** and a reverse proxy. Do not expose uvicorn directly.
- **Add authentication.** These endpoints are unauthenticated as written. Anyone
  who can reach `/api/ebay/search` is spending *your* eBay API quota.
- **Add rate limiting** at the proxy, both to protect your eBay quota and to
  stay inside eBay's published call limits.
- **Configure CORS explicitly** if a browser will call this. No CORS middleware
  is enabled by default — that is intentional, so nobody ships `allow_origins=["*"]`
  by accident.
- **Rotate credentials** if a secret is ever committed, logged, or shared.
  Rotation is the only real remedy; deleting the commit is not.

### Conduct

This backend uses **eBay's official, documented REST APIs** over HTTPS with a
properly obtained OAuth token. It does **not** scrape HTML, solve or bypass
CAPTCHAs, bypass authentication, ignore `robots.txt`, or access marketplaces
that have not published a supported API. Only documented Browse query
parameters and filters are sent — no invented filters. Please keep it that way.

---

## Testing

```bash
python -m compileall app tests
pytest -q
```

**No test makes a live eBay call.** The OAuth and Browse round-trips are served
by `httpx.MockTransport`, and a `conftest.py` fixture strips every `EBAY_*`
variable from the environment so a developer machine with real credentials
cannot accidentally reach production.

Coverage includes: OAuth request construction, token reuse before expiry,
expiry/refresh, concurrent refresh serialization, search parameter
construction, input validation, normalization of complete and degenerate
payloads, invalid/missing prices, shipping-cost handling (including free vs.
unknown), credential redaction, the exact-5× boundary, sub-5× rejection, the
multiple-vs-ROI distinction, full fee-and-expense arithmetic, and every error
status code.

```

Transport, normalization, arithmetic, and routing are separate modules on
purpose: adding a marketplace should touch **one** new transport module and
**one** new normalizer, and nothing else.

The only global mutable state is the eBay token cache — a single
process-wide `EbayClient` whose cache is guarded by a `threading.Lock` with
double-checked locking, so N concurrent requests trigger exactly one token
handshake (there is a test for this).

---

## Next: Facebook Marketplace

`NormalizedListing` is already marketplace-neutral, and `source` accepts
`"facebook"` today. Adding it should require no change to the profitability
engine, the response envelope, or any client.

**Planned shape:**

1. `app/services/facebook_client.py` — transport, mirroring `EbayClient`:
   OAuth token handling, a locked token cache, explicit timeouts, and the same
   exception vocabulary (`AuthError` / `RateLimitError` / `ApiError` /
   `ResponseError`) so `main.py`'s handlers map it to the same status codes.
2. `normalize_facebook_item(raw_item: dict) -> NormalizedListing` in
   `app/services/normalization.py`, sharing the existing `to_decimal` /
   `to_text` / `to_datetime` / `sanitize_raw` helpers.
3. `GET /api/facebook/search` returning the **same** `ListingSearchResponse`
   envelope, plus an optional `sources` parameter on a combined search endpoint.
4. Fields with no Facebook equivalent (`seller_feedback_score`, `item_end_time`)
   stay `None` — which is precisely why every field is optional.

**The blocker is access, not code.** Facebook Marketplace has **no public
listing-search API**. Legitimate paths are limited, and scraping is not one of
them — it violates Meta's Terms of Service, and this project will not do it.
A production integration requires an approved Meta commerce/catalog API
partnership or an equivalent authorized data source. Until such access is
granted, the Facebook client should remain unimplemented rather than faked.

The same discipline applies here as to eBay: whatever the source, a listing
price is an **asking** price until sold-comparable data says otherwise.
